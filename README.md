POFY smart contract is a mixture of deflationary reflection tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating and auto-staking protocol on Binance Smart Chain. 3% of each transaction goes to liquidity with a rolling 4 year lock period to protect the financial integrity and usability of the POFY token, and another 5% goes to all POFY token holders based on stake. Along with the 250 Trillion initial burn, there is a 1 Trillion POFY token burn each of the first 100 days, presenting a powerful and exponential burn mechanics to ensure both stability and growth of SPNX token over time. A secondary burn mechanism also integrated in effect, with a goal to consistently keep the liquidity at 10% of circulating supply. Any unlocked liquidity above that 10% will also be burned. We have made a fair launch without a pre-sale and there are no team tokens. Luckily, no manipulation, no whales. Just the sound of a growing community.
